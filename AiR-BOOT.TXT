AiR-BOOT-v1.1.1-testing                                                feb 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This v1.1.1-testing cycle will be relatively short with the main purpose of
integrating some patches and fixes from the local dev-queue. After things look
good enough a v1.1.2-RELEASE will be done.

Once on v1.1.3-testing, the plan is to also integrate the building of the INF
and PDF documentation into this project. That part will require LFNs, but the
building of core AiR-BOOT files, like the installers and of course the
bootloader itself will remain doable on 8.3 FAT systems.





===============================================================================
AiR-BOOT version 1.1.0-RELEASE                                         apr 2013
===============================================================================

This is the version as included on the eCS v2.2-beta CD's.
It was technically a pre-v1.1.0 release, with the final v1.1.0, including some
minor patches, to be included with eCS v2.2-GA. Because this version is now
known to be v1.1.0, we'll keep it that way. The minor patches and meanwhile
done fixes will soon appear as v1.1.1 test-version commits to be consolidated
to a v1.1.2 release. Issues regarding removable media are planned for the
v1.1.4 release as this requires removal of obsolete code and optimizing
existing code to create space in the ~32K block (track0) the loader resides in.

With this version of AiR-BOOT, the display of the version number has changed
to be compatible with the WarpIN versioning system.
So all digits are now separated by a dot.
This change is only visual and tools relying on the way AiR-BOOT stores it's
version numer internally are not affected.


The following has been fixed:

- AiR-BOOT cleared the bootable flag on all drives (TRAC ticket #6)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  This interferred with booting other drives, not containing AiR-BOOT,
  directly from the BIOS. Now AiR-BOOT only clears the bootable-flag on the
  boot-drive, which is the one where AiR-BOOT got activated from.

  AiR-BOOT would use INT13X extensions before checking their availability
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now the availability of INT13X is checked and a popup is displayed and the
  system halted when they are not available. INT13X is a requirement for
  this and higher versions of AiR-BOOT.

- AiR-BOOT does not remember drive-letters (issue #2987)
  ------------------------------------------------------
  When using the drive-letter feature, AB would not remember the drive-letter.
  This has been fixed.

  The purpose of this feature is to force a drive-letter onto the booting
  system if it otherwise refuses to boot. ("... cannot operate harddrive ...")
  This would occure on systems that have been formatted with HPFS and have
  their system restored from archive. (i.e. from a zip-file)
  In this case the HPFS partition misses the information needed by the loader
  to indicate which drive-letter to use. (issues #3067 and #3119)
  A SYSINSTX would solve such a problem, as did the dl-feature in AB v1.06.

  With this 1.1.0 version, this feature has become almost obsolete.
  If the information is missing from the HPFS partition, AB recreates it
  from the LVM information related to that partition.
  It only does that in memory, just before booting the system and thus does not
  alter/fix the HPFS partition on disk. The user can do that by regenerating
  the system using SYSINSTX.

  When using multiple eComStation systems installed on the same drive-letter,
  the drive-letter feature is still needed to force the correct letter on the
  system being booted and hide the others. See the documentation on how to
  install multiple OS/2 systems using the same drive-letter.

  Another case where the drive-letter feature can still be of value is when
  restoring a pre-LVM system from archive to an HPFS partition.
  In this case there will be no LVM information AiR-BOOT can use, so the
  user can use the dl-feature to force the proper boot-drive.
  After booting the pre-LVM system, it's advised to do a SYSINSTX to
  permanently fix the HPFS partition. After that, the dl-feature can be
  turned off since now the proper information is present.

  Yet another situation might occur when the ordering of primary partitions
  is changed. There are situations when partitioning an empty harddisk,
  the LVM subsystem creates so called cross-linked entries.
  This means that the first pointer in the partition table does not point to
  the first partition on disk. This can happen when creating multiple
  partitions in MiniLVM and saving them all at once.
  Good practice is to create-save-create-save...

  Having primary partitions cross-linked is normally not a problem,
  but if the user corrects the ordering, i.e. with Linux fdisk (not advised!),
  the relation between those primaries and their LVM information
  might get mixed up. (The LVM-info is still in the old order)
  In this case the AiR-BOOT drive-letter feature could be used to force
  the correct drive-letter. The user should recreate the LVM-info with
  MiniLVM by unssigning and reassigning the drive-letters for the primary
  partitions to regenerate the LVM information. After this,
  the partition should boot and the dl-feature can be turned off.

  * Please note that the dl-feature should be used with caution *
  Supplying incorrect information can cause system boot failure !
  The drive-letter entered in this feature should be the same as the one
  used in the CONFIG.SYS corresponding to that system.

  As a convenience, a drive-letter in the dl-feature pop-up can now be set
  to "Disabled" by pressing backspace.
  (As opposed to arrowing up/down to get to the "Disabled" entry)



- HPFS zero-drive boot-bug (issues #3067 and #3119)
  -------------------------------------------------
  AiR-BOOT would sometimes refuse to boot older OS/2 systems on HPFS.
  This has been fixed.

  The nature of this bug is described above.
  AiR-BOOT now checks for this condition and tries to use the drive-letter
  from the partition's LVM info. If that's not possible, the system will refuse
  to boot and the user can reset the system and turn on the dl-feature
  to force a boot-drive. The system should then boot, after which the user is
  advised to repair the HPFS volume by regenerating the system with SYSINSTX.



- Double 'I13X' signature (issue #3002)
  -------------------------------------
  The LVM-engine from eComStation v1.x puts the 'I13X' signature in a
  different location in the MBR (Master Boot Record) than the
  LVM-engine from eComStation v2.x does.
  The true impact of this is unknown at the time but could involve scenario's
  where a v1.x IBM-BM is used with a v2.x generated MBR, or vice-versa.
  (Not advised or supported anyway)
  Previous versions of AiR-BOOT used the v1.x location of the signature.
  Starting with v1.1.0 the 'I13X' signature is at both places in the AB MBR.



- Windows cannot find NTLDR/BOOTMGR (issue #3064)
  ---------------------------------------
  AiR-BOOT v1.07 could not boot Windows XP/Vista/7 if it was installed in a
  logical partition.
  This has been fixed.

  Unlike OS/2 and eComStation, Windows cannot truly boot from a logical
  partition. It always needs a primary partition where it can store it's
  loader. When the partition used for the loader is FAT32, the loader code
  cannot find the NT kernel-loader (a file on disk) if the field that
  otherwise belongs to the physical disk identifier is overwritten.
  This field has a different meaning in FAT32 and AiR-BOOT now treats it
  as such.



- Contact information corrected
  -----------------------------
  An unfortunate mistake was made with v1.07 in that it contained the *wrong*
  contact information in it's SETUP display.
  This still pointed to the sourceforge site, causing lot of confusion.
  Version 1.07 and up reside on Netlabs, see the end of this document for
  links.



- Release date corrected
  ----------------------
  AB v1.07 internally had the release date of v1.06.
  AB v1.1.0 has a correct internal release date.
  This is a non-impact fix.




Note:
-----
The fixes above also involved the installer, AIRBOOT2.EXE and SET(A)BOOT.EXE
of which new versions are provided.
Therefore, you should not try to install v1.1.0 by using the v1.07 installer.
It will report a broken configuration while this is not the case.






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
AiR-BOOT version 1.07-RELEASE                                          may 2011
=============================

With eComStation v2.1, as released in may 2011, AiR-BOOT replaces the familiar
but aging IBM Boot Manager. While it is still possible to use IBM-BM,
it will not function correctly on huge disks (>502GiB) or play well in
conjunction with Windows 7 OEM installations.

While AiR-BOOT v1.06, the latest version by it's original developer
Martin Kiewitz, could almost be used as-is, a couple of things needed to be
fixed.

These include the following:


- Support for eComStation phase1
  ------------------------------
  When eComStation is being installed, it needs to reboot the system without
  displaying any boot-manager menu after completing phase1.
  With IBM-BM installed, it "programs" it using the SETBOOT utility.
  While AiR-BOOT v1.06 already contained SET(A)BOOT, this functionality
  was lacking. It has been implemented starting with the v1.07 version.



- Support for huge disks (>502MiB)
  --------------------------------
  When using eComStation on huge disks, it uses a special geometry that
  has a different number of sectors per track. (127 or 255 instead of 63).
  This impacts the location of the LVM information which is usually stored in
  the last sector of track0 or just below the logical partition. Also,
  partitions do not start at a multiple of 63 sectors anymore, but on a
  multiple of 127 or 255 sectors, depending on the size of the disk.
  Support for huge disks has been implemented starting with v1.07.



- Support for legacy systems on huge disks
  ----------------------------------------
  Since it's always best to use the OS/2 Volume Manager (MiniLVM) to partition
  disks that also contain OS/2 volumes, on huge disks this implies that such
  volumes have a different alignment due to the special geometry in use.
  With v1.07 support has been added for booting legacy systems like PC-DOS
  and FreeDOS and the DOS based 32-bit versions of Windows (95/98/ME) on
  such huge disks.



- Adjusted color-theme
  ---------------------
  While the bright and shiny colors of v1.06 are arguably nice, they do not
  fit a distinguished product like eComStation.
  To prevent "culture shock", the color-theme has been adjusted to more
  resemble the IBM Boot Manager.




Note:
-----
I't important to know that AiR-BOOT versions 1.07 and up are *not* developed
by the original autor, Martin Kiewitz.
Technically, version 1.07 and up are forks of the 1.06 version and maintained
by a different developer. As such, addressing the original author with regard
to v1.07 and up is not the correct path.

The eComStation version of AiR-BOOT resides on Netlabs and not on Sourceforge.
