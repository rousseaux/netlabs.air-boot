Information on AiR-BOOT Manual Creation                            [2017-04-13]
===============================================================================

Apache OpenOffice Writer for the Master Document
------------------------------------------------
The AiR-BOOT Manual is provided in the PDF and OS/2 INF formats.
Of course we do not want to maintain both formats separately, so a sort of
_master_ format is required. This is found in the Open Document Format (ODF)
used by Apache OpenOffice, especially the ODT-variant used by AOO-Writer.

The port of Apache OpenOffice for OS/2 is provided by "bww bitwise works GmbH".

The Master Document
-------------------
The file "airboot-manual.odt" is the master document in ODT-format.
It can be modified using AOO-Writer. Before putting a new version in the
repository, it is always reconstructed from its exploded form.


The AiR-BOOT Manual in PDF-format
---------------------------------
This is done using the excellent PDF-export feature of Apache OpenOffice.
The steps are:
o Reconstruct the master-document
o Load it in AOO for OS/2
o Manually export it to PDF


The AiR-BOOT Manual in INF-format
---------------------------------
This is done using XSLT.
Because an ODT is actually a ZIP-file, with the file 'content.xml' holding the
document-content in XML-form, it can be processed by XSLT.

Construction of the manual is done by:
o Exploding the ODT to a subdirectory                 -- UNZIP
o Transforming 'content.xml' to 'airboot-manual.ipf'  -- XSLTPROC
o Converting PNG images to OS/2 BMP images            -- GBMCONV
o Compiling IPF to INF                                -- WIPFC


Conversion of the embedded images
---------------------------------
AOO embedded images are stored in PNG-format.
Since the IPF creation tools can only handle OS/2 bitmap format, these images
must first be converted from PNG to OS/2 BMP. This is done with the 'gbmconv'
utility, which is part of the 'Generalised Bitmap Module' (GBM) package.

Be sure that any old "?:\os2\dll\gbm.dll" is *not* active when using 'gbmconv'!

The Generalised Bitmap Module is provided by "Heiko Nitzsche".
