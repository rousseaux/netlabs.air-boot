ACA BIN2OBJ 1.10b Tutorial


The command line parameters for ACA BIN2OBJ is

	BIN2OBJ Name.obj _NAME_DATA_ DATA WORD _Name_ Name.dat
	^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
	   0        1         2        3    4     5      6
	0:  executable name
	1:  object file name
	2:  data segment name
	3:  class type         "DATA" or "FAR_DATA"
	4:  segment alignment  "BYTE", "WORD", "PARA", or "PAGE"
	5:  public name
	6:  binary data file

None of these parameters could be omit.


0.	Executable name.  Of course, you need BIN2OBJ.EXE to run.

1.	Object file name.  Choose a reasonable name for your object
	file.  Besure add .OBJ extension because BIN2OBJ won't add
	it for you.

2.	Data segment name.  This is the name for the data segment.
	It could be anything, but the best choice is to be the same
	name as the _DATA or _FARDATA if the data segment does not
	exceed 64K so that these data segment can be packed together
	by linker.  If there are going to be many files inserted into
	an executable, it is also a good choice to creat a unique
	segment name for them.

3.	Class type.  It usually should be "DATA" or "FAR_DATA".  If
	you want put it at END of the executable, choose other names.
	Be sure to check the linker map file.

4.	Segment alignment.  This part tells linker how to align your
	data segment.  either at byte (any where), word   (even place),
	para (paragraph or 16 byte), or page (256 bytes) boundary.  If
	you choose the data segment name as _DATA or _FARDATA that are
	compiler default, this part should be PARA.  If the data segment
	is to be associated with a segment register with index offset
	0, then the data segment should also be PARA.  Otherwise, BYTE
	or WORD doesn't seem to matter much.

5.	Public name.  This is the name of the identifier.  If the
	identifier is used in C, there should be a underscore '_'
	character at the beginning.  The actually data type can
	be defined as any type of pointer.  The data type is not
	defined here.

6.	Binary data file.  ACA BIN2OBJ treats any data file as binary.
	So if you just want print a long ascii text file on screen, it
	should be fine.  But it is better to remove all CR's (carriage
	returns) in the text file.  See the test file comment to get
	more informations.


Example:

	bin2obj introdoc.obj _RES_DATA DATA BYTE _IntroText test.txt
	bin2obj intropic.obj _RES_DATA DATA BYTE _IntroPict test.vga

	Linker will automatically pack these object files into one
	segment.
	
	Note the underscores '_' at the beginning of two names at
	command line.  They are required in C.

	The data type of _IntroText and _IntroPict in C are
		extern unsigned char IntroText[1];
		extern unsigned char IntroPict[1];
	extern unsigned char[1] data type will tell the C compiler
	that IntroText and IntroPict are arrays of unsigned chars.
	They can be treated as pointers.
