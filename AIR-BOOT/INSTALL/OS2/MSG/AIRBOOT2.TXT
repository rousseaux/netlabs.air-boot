   Your harddisc does not have at least 62 sectors per track.%0
ABI0015I: not willing to install
   Your harddisc contains EZ-SETUP.
   This program is required, so your computer is able to access the harddisc
   completly. Installation of AiR-BOOT would overwrite it.%0

-> ...!ATTENTION!... <-
ABI0026I: Probably your system was infected by a virus.
ABI0027I: Your system GOT infected by a stealth-virus (or your MBR got trashed).
ABI0028I: Repairing AiR-BOOT will normally squash the virus.
But to be sure it''s gone, you should check your harddisc using a virus-scanner.
ABI0029I: 
AiR-BOOT detected that the virus has broken your partition-table.
ABI0030I: Good news: AiR-BOOT has found a (hopefully) functional backup.
Shall I use this backup, instead of the current active one ? (Y/N)
ABI0031I: Sadly the virus also broke AiR-BOOT's backup. You will have to help yourself.
ABI0032I: 

AiR-BOOT detected that the data on your harddisc got damaged.
If you had AiR-BOOT installed before: The corruption killed AiR-BOOT completly!
ABI0033I:

ABI0034I:  <A> - Add AiR-BOOT 'v%1/%2' on current system
